= Cookbooks

Rather than keep all my separate cookbooks at the top level of the project, I've nested them here.

opscode-cookbooks:: A vendored copy of http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks. It's a shame Heroku doesn't support git submodules.
site-cookbooks:: My own cookbooks, for my own nefarious purposes.

Note that <tt>ChefServerSlice::Application</tt> requires[http://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/0.7.8/chef-server-slice/app/controllers/application.rb#L201] cookbook folder names to end with the string "cookbooks", otherwise I wouldn't here.
